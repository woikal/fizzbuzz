Enterprise FizzBuzz is an application which I put together to test a variety of tools and techniques. I cam across the original problem specification at codinghorror.com

  * Print the numbers from 1 to 100
  * If a number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" instead
  * If a number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz" instead
  * If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead

Easy peasy. I wanted to do it the hard way. BTW the original blog entry describing why I did this is here http://codermike.com/if-something-is-worth-doing
